Hello Everyone.

This is my first filter list I made myself. It includes advanced anti-adblocking filters and a tracker list from Better.fyi.

Please report the problem if you found my list breaking some websites. Please includes which filter line breaks the website so I can test it and make it perfect =D.

I would also recommend the following host file subscription link below:

https://adaway.org/hosts.txt
https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt
https://blocklistproject.github.io/Lists/tracking.txt
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/NoFormatting/hosts.final
https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/zero/hosts
https://ewpratten.retrylife.ca/youtube_ad_blocklist/hosts.ipv4.txt
https://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=hosts&showintro=0&mimetype=plaintext

They works very well on my Android Adguard DNS filtering function.
