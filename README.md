Hello Everyone.

This is my first filter list I made myself. It includes advanced anti-adblocking filters and a tracker list from Better.fyi.

Please report the problem if you found my list breaking some websites. Please includes which filter line breaks the website so I can test it and make it perfect =D.

I would also recommend the following host file subscription link below:

- https://adaway.org/hosts.txt
- https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt
- https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/2_optimized.txt
- https://anti-ad.net/adguard.txt
- https://blocklistproject.github.io/Lists/tracking.txt
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/NoFormatting/hosts.final
- https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/zero/hosts
- https://ewpratten.retrylife.ca/youtube_ad_blocklist/hosts.ipv4.txt
- https://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=hosts&showintro=0&mimetype=plaintext

They works very well on my Android Adguard DNS filtering function.

Extra list: (For Chinese Language User) (EasyList China + AdGuard Chinese filter. Filter list that specifically removes ads on websites in Chinese language.)
